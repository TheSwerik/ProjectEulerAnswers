# Leonhard Euler (/ˈɔɪlər/ OY-lər;[2] German: [ˈɔʏlɐ] (About this soundlisten)[3]; 15 April 1707 – 18 September 1783)
# was a Swiss mathematician, physicist, astronomer, geographer, logician and engineer who made important and
# influential discoveries in many branches of mathematics, such as infinitesimal calculus and graph theory,
# while also making pioneering contributions to several branches such as topology and analytic number theory. He also
# introduced much of the modern mathematical terminology and notation, particularly for mathematical analysis,
# such as the notion of a mathematical function.[4] He is also known for his work in mechanics, fluid dynamics,
# optics, astronomy and music theory.[5] Euler was one of the most eminent mathematicians of the 18th century and is
# held to be one of the greatest in history. He is also widely considered to be the most prolific, as his collected
# works fill 92 volumes,[6] more than anyone else in the field. He spent most of his adult life in Saint Petersburg,
# Russia, and in Berlin, then the capital of Prussia. A statement attributed to Pierre-Simon Laplace expresses
# Euler's influence on mathematics: "Read Euler, read Euler, he is the master of us all." Early life Leonhard Euler
# was born on 15 April 1707, in Basel, Switzerland, to Paul III Euler, a pastor of the Reformed Church,
# and Marguerite née Brucker, a pastor's daughter. He had two younger sisters, Anna Maria and Maria Magdalena,
# and a younger brother, Johann Heinrich.[9] Soon after the birth of Leonhard, the Eulers moved from Basel to the
# town of Riehen, where Leonhard spent most of his childhood. Paul was a friend of the Bernoulli family; Johann
# Bernoulli, then regarded as Europe's foremost mathematician, would eventually be the most important influence on
# young Leonhard.
#
# Euler's formal education started in Basel, where he was sent to live with his maternal grandmother. In 1720,
# at age thirteen, he enrolled at the University of Basel. In 1723, he received a Master of Philosophy with a
# dissertation that compared the philosophies of Descartes and Newton. During that time, he was receiving Saturday
# afternoon lessons from Johann Bernoulli, who quickly discovered his new pupil's incredible talent for mathematics.[
# 10] At that time Euler's main studies included theology, Greek and Hebrew at his father's urging to become a
# pastor, but Bernoulli convinced his father that Leonhard was destined to become a great mathematician.
#
# In 1726, Euler completed a dissertation on the propagation of sound with the title De Sono.[11] At that time,
# he was unsuccessfully attempting to obtain a position at the University of Basel. In 1727, he first entered the
# Paris Academy Prize Problem competition; the problem that year was to find the best way to place the masts on a
# ship. Pierre Bouguer, who became known as "the father of naval architecture", won and Euler took second place.
# Euler later won this annual prize twelve times.[12]
#
# Career Saint Petersburg Around this time Johann Bernoulli's two sons, Daniel and Nicolaus, were working at the
# Imperial Russian Academy of Sciences in Saint Petersburg. On 31 July 1726, Nicolaus died of appendicitis after
# spending less than a year in Russia.[13][14] When Daniel assumed his brother's position in the mathematics/physics
# division, he recommended that the post in physiology that he had vacated be filled by his friend Euler. In November
# 1726 Euler eagerly accepted the offer, but delayed making the trip to Saint Petersburg while he unsuccessfully
# applied for a physics professorship at the University of Basel.[15]

# great mathematician, academician Leonhard Euler. Euler arrived in Saint Petersburg on 17 May 1727. He was promoted
# from his junior post in the medical department of the academy to a position in the mathematics department. He
# lodged with Daniel Bernoulli with whom he often worked in close collaboration. Euler mastered Russian and settled
# into life in Saint Petersburg. He also took on an additional job as a medic in the Russian Navy.[16]
#
# The Academy at Saint Petersburg, established by Peter the Great, was intended to improve education in Russia and to
# close the scientific gap with Western Europe. As a result, it was made especially attractive to foreign scholars
# like Euler. The academy possessed ample financial resources and a comprehensive library drawn from the private
# libraries of Peter himself and of the nobility. Very few students were enrolled in the academy to lessen the
# faculty's teaching burden. The academy emphasized research and offered to its faculty both the time and the freedom
# to pursue scientific questions.[12]
#
# The Academy's benefactress, Catherine I, who had continued the progressive policies of her late husband,
# died on the day of Euler's arrival. The Russian nobility then gained power upon the ascension of the
# twelve-year-old Peter II. The nobility, suspicious of the academy's foreign scientists, cut funding and caused
# other difficulties for Euler and his colleagues.
#
# Conditions improved slightly after the death of Peter II, and Euler swiftly rose through the ranks in the academy
# and was made a professor of physics in 1731. Two years later, Daniel Bernoulli, who was fed up with the censorship
# and hostility he faced at Saint Petersburg, left for Basel. Euler succeeded him as the head of the mathematics
# department.[17]
#
# On 7 January 1734, he married Katharina Gsell (1707–1773), a daughter of Georg Gsell, a painter from the Academy
# Gymnasium.[18] The young couple bought a house by the Neva River. Of their thirteen children, only five survived
# childhood.[19]

# turmoil in Russia, Euler left St. Petersburg on 19 June 1741 to take up a post at the Berlin Academy, which he had
# been offered by Frederick the Great of Prussia. He lived for 25 years in Berlin, where he wrote over 380 articles.
# In Berlin, he published the two works for which he would become most renowned: the Introductio in analysin
# infinitorum, a text on functions published in 1748, and the Institutiones calculi differentialis,[20] published in
# 1755 on differential calculus.[21] In 1755, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.
#
# In addition, Euler was asked to tutor Friederike Charlotte of Brandenburg-Schwedt, the Princess of Anhalt-Dessau
# and Frederick's niece. Euler wrote over 200 letters to her in the early 1760s, which were later compiled into a
# best-selling volume entitled Letters of Euler on different Subjects in Natural Philosophy Addressed to a German
# Princess.[22] This work contained Euler's exposition on various subjects pertaining to physics and mathematics,
# as well as offering valuable insights into Euler's personality and religious beliefs. This book became more widely
# read than any of his mathematical works and was published across Europe and in the United States. The popularity of
# the "Letters" testifies to Euler's ability to communicate scientific matters effectively to a lay audience,
# a rare ability for a dedicated research scientist.[21]
#
# Despite Euler's immense contribution to the Academy's prestige, he eventually incurred the ire of Frederick and
# ended up having to leave Berlin. The Prussian king had a large circle of intellectuals in his court, and he found
# the mathematician unsophisticated and ill-informed on matters beyond numbers and figures. Euler was a simple,
# devoutly religious man who never questioned the existing social order or conventional beliefs, in many ways the
# polar opposite of Voltaire, who enjoyed a high place of prestige at Frederick's court. Euler was not a skilled
# debater and often made it a point to argue subjects that he knew little about, making him the frequent target of
# Voltaire's wit.[21] Frederick also expressed disappointment with Euler's practical engineering abilities:
#
# I wanted to have a water jet in my garden: Euler calculated the force of the wheels necessary to raise the water to
# a reservoir, from where it should fall back through channels, finally spurting out in Sanssouci. My mill was
# carried out geometrically and could not raise a mouthful of water closer than fifty paces to the reservoir. Vanity
# of vanities! Vanity of geometry![23]
#
# Personal life Eyesight deterioration Euler's eyesight worsened throughout his mathematical career. In 1738,
# three years after nearly expiring from fever, he became almost blind in his right eye, but Euler rather blamed the
# painstaking work on cartography he performed for the St. Petersburg Academy for his condition. Euler's vision in
# that eye worsened throughout his stay in Germany, to the extent that Frederick referred to him as "Cyclops". Euler
# remarked on his loss of vision, "Now I will have fewer distractions."[24] He later developed a cataract in his left
# eye, which was discovered in 1766. Just a few weeks after its discovery, a failed surgical restoration rendered him
# almost totally blind. He was 59 years old then. However, his condition appeared to have little effect on his
# productivity, as he compensated for it with his mental calculation skills and exceptional memory. For example,
# Euler could repeat the Aeneid of Virgil from beginning to end without hesitation, and for every page in the edition
# he could indicate which line was the first and which the last. With the aid of his scribes, Euler's productivity on
# many areas of study actually increased. He produced, on average, one mathematical paper every week in the year
# 1775.[25] The Eulers bore a double name, Euler-Schölpi, the latter of which derives from schelb and schief,
# signifying squint-eyed, cross-eyed, or crooked. This suggests that the Eulers may have had a susceptibility to eye
# problems.[26]
#
# Return to Russia and death In 1760, with the Seven Years' War raging, Euler's farm in Charlottenburg was ransacked
# by advancing Russian troops. Upon learning of this event, General Ivan Petrovich Saltykov paid compensation for the
# damage caused to Euler's estate, with Empress Elizabeth of Russia later adding a further payment of 4000 roubles—an
# exorbitant amount at the time.[27] The political situation in Russia stabilized after Catherine the Great's
# accession to the throne, so in 1766 Euler accepted an invitation to return to the St. Petersburg Academy. His
# conditions were quite exorbitant—a 3000 ruble annual salary, a pension for his wife, and the promise of
# high-ranking appointments for his sons. All of these requests were granted. He spent the rest of his life in
# Russia. However, his second stay in the country was marred by tragedy. A fire in St. Petersburg in 1771 cost him
# his home, and almost his life. In 1773, he lost his wife Katharina after 40 years of marriage.
#
# Three years after his wife's death, Euler married her half-sister, Salome Abigail Gsell (1723–1794).[28] This
# marriage lasted until his death. In 1782 he was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts
# and Sciences.[29]
#
# In St. Petersburg on 18 September 1783, after a lunch with his family, Euler was discussing the newly discovered
# planet Uranus and its orbit with a fellow academician Anders Johan Lexell, when he collapsed from a brain
# hemorrhage. He died a few hours later.[30] Jacob von Staehlin-Storcksburg wrote a short obituary for the Russian
# Academy of Sciences and Russian mathematician Nicolas Fuss, one of Euler's disciples, wrote a more detailed eulogy,
# [31] which he delivered at a memorial meeting. In his eulogy for the French Academy, French mathematician and
# philosopher Marquis de Condorcet, wrote:
#
# il cessa de calculer et de vivre— ... he ceased to calculate and to live.[32]
#
#
# Euler's grave at the Alexander Nevsky Monastery Euler was buried next to Katharina at the Smolensk Lutheran
# Cemetery on Goloday Island. In 1785, the Russian Academy of Sciences put a marble bust of Leonhard Euler on a
# pedestal next to the Director's seat and, in 1837, placed a headstone on Euler's grave. To commemorate the 250th
# anniversary of Euler's birth, the headstone was moved in 1956, together with his remains, to the 18th-century
# necropolis at the Alexander Nevsky Monastery.

# 60 and 80 quarto volumes.[25] Euler's name is associated with a large number of topics.
#
# Euler is the only mathematician to have two numbers named after him: the important Euler's number in calculus, e,
# approximately equal to 2.71828, and the Euler–Mascheroni constant γ (gamma) sometimes referred to as just "Euler's
# constant", approximately equal to 0.57721. It is not known whether γ is rational or irrational.[33]
#
# Mathematical notation Euler introduced and popularized several notational conventions through his numerous and
# widely circulated textbooks. Most notably, he introduced the concept of a function[4] and was the first to write f(
# x) to denote the function f applied to the argument x. He also introduced the modern notation for the trigonometric
# functions, the letter e for the base of the natural logarithm (now also known as Euler's number), the Greek letter
# Σ for summations and the letter i to denote the imaginary unit.[34] The use of the Greek letter π to denote the
# ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter was also popularized by Euler, although it originated with Welsh
# mathematician William Jones.[35]
#
# Analysis The development of infinitesimal calculus was at the forefront of 18th-century mathematical research,
# and the Bernoullis—family friends of Euler—were responsible for much of the early progress in the field. Thanks to
# their influence, studying calculus became the major focus of Euler's work. While some of Euler's proofs are not
# acceptable by modern standards of mathematical rigour[36] (in particular his reliance on the principle of the
# generality of algebra), his ideas led to many great advances. Euler is well known in analysis for his frequent use
# and development of power series, the expression of functions as sums of infinitely many terms, such as
#
# {\displaystyle e^{x}=\sum _{n=0}^{\infty }{x^{n} \over n!}=\lim _{n\to \infty }\left({\frac {1}{0!}}+{\frac {x}{
# 1!}}+{\frac {x^{2}}{2!}}+\cdots +{\frac {x^{n}}{n!}}\right).}e^{x}=\sum _{n=0}^{\infty }{x^{n} \over n!}=\lim _{
# n\to \infty }\left({\frac {1}{0!}}+{\frac {x}{1!}}+{\frac {x^{2}}{2!}}+\cdots +{\frac {x^{n}}{n!}}\right). Notably,
# Euler directly proved the power series expansions for e and the inverse tangent function. (Indirect proof via the
# inverse power series technique was given by Newton and Leibniz between 1670 and 1680.) His daring use of power
# series enabled him to solve the famous Basel problem in 1735 (he provided a more elaborate argument in 1741):[36]
#
# {\displaystyle \sum _{n=1}^{\infty }{1 \over n^{2}}=\lim _{n\to \infty }\left({\frac {1}{1^{2}}}+{\frac {1}{2^{
# 2}}}+{\frac {1}{3^{2}}}+\cdots +{\frac {1}{n^{2}}}\right)={\frac {\pi ^{2}}{6}}.}\sum _{n=1}^{\infty }{1 \over n^{
# 2}}=\lim _{n\to \infty }\left({\frac {1}{1^{2}}}+{\frac {1}{2^{2}}}+{\frac {1}{3^{2}}}+\cdots +{\frac {1}{n^{
# 2}}}\right)={\frac {\pi ^{2}}{6}}.
#
# A geometric interpretation of Euler's formula Euler introduced the use of the exponential function and logarithms
# in analytic proofs. He discovered ways to express various logarithmic functions using power series,
# and he successfully defined logarithms for negative and complex numbers, thus greatly expanding the scope of
# mathematical applications of logarithms.[34] He also defined the exponential function for complex numbers,
# and discovered its relation to the trigonometric functions. For any real number φ (taken to be radians),
# Euler's formula states that the complex exponential function satisfies
