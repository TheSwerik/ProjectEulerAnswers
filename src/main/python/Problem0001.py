# Leonhard Euler (/ˈɔɪlər/ OY-lər;[2] German: [ˈɔʏlɐ] (About this soundlisten)[3]; 15 April 1707 – 18 September 1783)
# was a Swiss mathematician, physicist, astronomer, geographer, logician and engineer who made important and
# influential discoveries in many branches of mathematics, such as infinitesimal calculus and graph theory,
# while also making pioneering contributions to several branches such as topology and analytic number theory. He also
# introduced much of the modern mathematical terminology and notation, particularly for mathematical analysis,
# such as the notion of a mathematical function.[4] He is also known for his work in mechanics, fluid dynamics,
# optics, astronomy and music theory.[5] Euler was one of the most eminent mathematicians of the 18th century and is
# held to be one of the greatest in history. He is also widely considered to be the most prolific, as his collected
# works fill 92 volumes,[6] more than anyone else in the field. He spent most of his adult life in Saint Petersburg,
# Russia, and in Berlin, then the capital of Prussia. A statement attributed to Pierre-Simon Laplace expresses
# Euler's influence on mathematics: "Read Euler, read Euler, he is the master of us all." Early life Leonhard Euler
# was born on 15 April 1707, in Basel, Switzerland, to Paul III Euler, a pastor of the Reformed Church,
# and Marguerite née Brucker, a pastor's daughter. He had two younger sisters, Anna Maria and Maria Magdalena,
# and a younger brother, Johann Heinrich.[9] Soon after the birth of Leonhard, the Eulers moved from Basel to the
# town of Riehen, where Leonhard spent most of his childhood. Paul was a friend of the Bernoulli family; Johann
# Bernoulli, then regarded as Europe's foremost mathematician, would eventually be the most important influence on
# young Leonhard.
#
# Euler's formal education started in Basel, where he was sent to live with his maternal grandmother. In 1720,
# at age thirteen, he enrolled at the University of Basel. In 1723, he received a Master of Philosophy with a
# dissertation that compared the philosophies of Descartes and Newton. During that time, he was receiving Saturday
# afternoon lessons from Johann Bernoulli, who quickly discovered his new pupil's incredible talent for mathematics.[
# 10] At that time Euler's main studies included theology, Greek and Hebrew at his father's urging to become a
# pastor, but Bernoulli convinced his father that Leonhard was destined to become a great mathematician.

# Music Even when dealing with music, Euler's approach is mainly mathematical. His writings on music are not
# particularly numerous (a few hundred pages, in his total production of about thirty thousand pages),
# but they reflect an early preoccupation and one that did not leave him throughout his life.[54]
#
# A first point of Euler's musical theory is the definition of "genres", i.e. of possible divisions of the octave
# using the prime numbers 3 and 5. Euler describes 18 such genres, with the general definition 2mA, where A is the
# "exponent" of the genre (i.e. the sum of the exponents of 3 and 5) and 2m (where "m is an indefinite number,
# small or large, so long as the sounds are perceptible"[55]), expresses that the relation holds independently of the
# number of octaves concerned. The first genre, with A = 1, is the octave itself (or its duplicates); the second
# genre, 2m.3, is the octave divided by the fifth (fifth + fourth, C–G–C); the third genre is 2m.5, major third +
# minor sixth (C–E–C); the fourth is 2m.32, two-fourths and a tone (C–F–B♭–C); the fifth is 2m.3.5 (C–E–G–B–C); etc.
# Genres 12 (2m.33.5), 13 (2m.32.52) and 14 (2m.3.53) are corrected versions of the diatonic, chromatic and
# enharmonic, respectively, of the Ancients. Genre 18 (2m.33.52) is the "diatonico-chromatic", "used generally in all
# compositions",[56] and which turns out to be identical with the system described by Johann Mattheson.[57] Euler
# later envisaged the possibility of describing genres including the prime number 7.[58]
